# Waveguide-sidewall-scattering-loss-evaluation-in-3D

Run "loss_in_dB_github.m" to compute sidewall scattering (can also be used for defect scattering)

Other files are functions that needed

Computing the sidewall scattering loss of photonic waveguides using volume current method.

%%%%%% Important note %%%%%

Most importantly, to run this code on matlab, you should download a FDM solver from:

https://www.photonics.umd.edu/software/wgmodes/

Credit & Citation for the FDM solver: 

Fallahkhair, Arman B., Kai S. Li, and Thomas E. Murphy. "Vector finite difference modesolver for anisotropic dielectric waveguides." Journal of Lightwave Technology 26.11 (2008): 1423-1431.

We will call several functions from "wgmodes": wgmodes.m, postprocess.m, contourmode.m 

Alternatively, you can use your own FDM or FEM solver to compute the mode profile.

The obtained mode profile serves as the input for dyadic Green's function

The code is simplified for the purpose of better interpretation, alternatively, one can use it to compute scattering loss from threading dislocations as well, simply by removing some commented lines.

Running the code, you will obtain several plots:

Figure 1: Mode profile (Ex, Ey, Ez)

Figure 2: "Volume current" at the sidewall, whose radiation is resonsible for the scattering loss

Figure 3: Distributaion of Poynting vector in the far field in polar plot. Coordinate is defined in Ref. 1
